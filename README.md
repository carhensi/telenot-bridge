## 🔒 Integrate Telenot Alarm System with HomeAssistant and HomeKit

This Node.js application serves as a bridge between the **Telenot Complex 400H** alarm system, **Home Assistant**, and **HomeKit**. It enables seamless integration, providing enhanced control and monitoring of your security system. Additionally, it supports a virtual `arm_night` mode, ideal for advanced automations. Devices in Home Assistant are automatically configured with appropriate vendor and sensor icons for a polished experience. Communication with the Telenot alarm system is facilitated via its existing RS232 interface.

Compared to the official Interface KNX 400 IP, this solution is significantly more cost-effective but does not provide the same level of robustness, features and is not VdS certified.

## 📦 Installation


```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/carhensi/telenot.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd telenot

# Install dependencies
yarn install

```


## 🔧 Hardware Requirement

To use this package, you need an RS232 to Ethernet TCP/IP server module. Specifically:
	•	USR-TCP232-302 Tiny - RS232 to Ethernet TCP/IP Server Module (available on Amazon)

This module allows your program to connect using a socket connection to receive data from the Telenot system. For this to work the port needs to be configured for GMS output.

## 🔧 Configuration

* Rename .env.example to .env:

```bash
cp -r config-example config
cp .env.example .env
```

* Edit the .env file with your configuration:

```bash
# MQTT Configuration
MQTTHOST=mqtt://your_mqtt_broker
MQTTPORT=1883
MQTTUSER="your_mqtt_username"
MQTTPASSWORD="your_mqtt_password"

# Telnet Configuration
TELNETHOST=your_telenot_ip
TELNETPORT=your_telenot_port

# Other configurations...
```

## 🏃‍♂️ Usage

Development Mode

`yarn dev`

Production Mode

```bash
docker run -i -t \
   --env-file=.env \
   -v $(pwd)/logs:/usr/src/app/logs \
   -v $(pwd)/locations:/usr/src/app/config/locations \
   ghcr.io/carhensi/telenot:latest
```

## 📡 HomeAssistant Integration

Ensure that `HOMEASSISTANT_AUTODISCOVERY` is set to true in your `.env` file to enable automatic discovery of your Telenot sensors in HomeAssistant.

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes Jest tests with excellent coverage (>99%). To run the tests:

`yarn test`

For coverage report:

`yarn test:coverage`
